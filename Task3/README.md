# Task 3: Recommendation System

This project implements a simple recommendation system that suggests
movies or games to users based on their personal preferences.

The system uses a content-based filtering approach, where items are
recommended by comparing their attributes with user-provided ratings.

## Features
- Supports both movie and game recommendations
- Question-based user input for personalized suggestions
- Uses custom attributes instead of generic genres
- Displays top 3 recommendations based on relevance

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Content-based filtering
- Basic similarity scoring

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed
2. Navigate to the Task3 directory
3. Run the program using:
   python recommendation_system.py
4. Choose movies or games and answer the questions

## Learning Outcome
This task demonstrates how recommendation systems can be built using
user preferences and attribute-based similarity comparison.
