# CODSOFT Internship Tasks

This repository contains the tasks completed as part of the CodSoft
Tech Internship. Each task is implemented using Python and focuses
on building a clear understanding of core programming concepts.

All tasks are organized into separate folders with their respective
source code and documentation.

## Task 1: Rule-Based Chatbot

This task involves building a simple rule-based chatbot that responds
to user inputs using predefined rules and conditional statements.
The chatbot demonstrates basic conversation flow and decision-making.

Key concepts covered:
- Conditional logic using if-else statements
- String processing
- Basic conversation flow

## Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Human vs Computer)

This task implements a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human
player competes against the computer. The computer uses logical
decision-making to choose its moves based on the game state.

Key concepts covered:
- Game logic and turn-based systems
- Decision-making algorithms
- Win, loss, and draw detection
- Use of functions and control flow

## Task 3: Recommendation System

This task implements a simple recommendation system that suggests
movies or games based on user preferences. The system asks the user
a set of questions and recommends items by comparing preference
scores with predefined attributes.

Key concepts covered:
- Content-based filtering
- Preference scoring
- Data comparison and similarity logic
- User-driven recommendations

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Basic Data Structures
- Conditional Logic
- Algorithmic Problem Solving

## How to Run the Projects

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system
2. Clone or download this repository
3. Navigate to the required task folder
4. Run the Python file using:
   python filename.py

Each task folder contains its own README file with detailed
instructions on how to run the program.

## Learning Outcome

Through these tasks, I gained practical experience in implementing
logic-based applications, understanding fundamental concepts behind
chatbots, games, and recommendation systems, and writing clean and
structured Python code.
