# Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI

This project implements an AI agent that plays the game of Tic-Tac-Toe
against a human player using the Minimax algorithm.

The AI evaluates all possible game states and selects the optimal move,
making it impossible to defeat if it plays first or second.

## Features
- Human vs AI gameplay
- Unbeatable AI using Minimax
- Detects wins, losses, and draws
- Console-based interaction

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Minimax algorithm
- Basic game theory concepts

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed
2. Navigate to the Task2 directory
3. Run the game using:
   python tic_tac_toe.py
4. Play as X against the AI

## Learning Outcome
This task demonstrates how game theory and search algorithms can be
used to build optimal decision-making agents.
