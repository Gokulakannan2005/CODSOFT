# Task 1: Rule-Based Chatbot (Virtual Assistant)

This project implements a simple rule-based chatbot using Python.
The chatbot responds to user inputs based on predefined rules
implemented using if-else conditions and basic string matching.

The chatbot is designed with a clean virtual assistant-style
interaction to simulate structured conversation flow.

## Features
- Responds to greetings and common questions
- Provides guided help instructions
- Displays the current system time
- Handles unknown inputs gracefully
- Ends conversations using exit commands

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Rule-based Natural Language Processing

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system
2. Navigate to the Task1 directory
3. Run the program using:
   python chatbot.py
4. Interact with the chatbot through the terminal

## Learning Outcome
This task demonstrates how rule-based logic can be used to
control conversation flow and simulate a basic virtual assistant.
